I strongly recommend taking your son to see a healthcare provider today - either your pediatrician if they can see him immediately, or an urgent care/ER if not. While waiting, you can give age-appropriate doses of acetaminophen (Tylenol) to manage the fever, ensure he stays hydrated, and monitor for any worsening symptoms like lethargy, difficulty breathing, or changes in consciousness.",

Continue taking your medication as prescribed unless directed otherwise by your healthcare provider. To help reduce the swelling, you might try elevating your legs when sitting or lying down, reducing salt intake, and avoiding prolonged standing. If the swelling becomes severe, is accompanied by facial swelling, difficulty breathing, or other concerning symptoms, seek medical attention immediately as these could indicate a more serious reaction.",

While waiting for emergency services, if available and not contraindicated by other medical conditions, you may chew a regular-strength aspirin (325 mg) or four low-dose aspirins (81 mg each).
